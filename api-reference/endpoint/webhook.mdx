title: 'New Plant'
openapi: 'WEBHOOK /plant/webhook'
---

## Overview

Receive notifications when a new plant is added to the store.

- **Method**: POST (incoming from server)
- **Path**: `/plant/webhook`
- **Auth**: As configured by your server (no auth enforced by spec)

## Event payload

- Content-Type: `application/json`
- Schema: `NewPlant`

```json
{
  "id": 1001,
  "name": "Aloe Vera",
  "tag": "succulent"
}
```

## Example receivers

```javascript
// Node.js (Express)
import express from 'express';
const app = express();
app.use(express.json());
app.post('/plant/webhook', (req, res) => {
  const event = req.body; // validate signature here if used
  console.log('New plant:', event);
  res.sendStatus(200);
});
app.listen(3000);
```

```python
# Python (Flask)
from flask import Flask, request
app = Flask(__name__)
@app.post('/plant/webhook')
def plant_webhook():
    event = request.get_json()
    print('New plant:', event)
    return ('', 200)
```

## Best practices

- Respond with 200 quickly to acknowledge receipt, then process asynchronously.
- If you use signatures, verify them before trusting the payload.
